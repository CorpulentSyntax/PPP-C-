# PPP-C-
Schoolproject

Exercises from Stroustrup's "Programming – Principles and Practice Using C++" (First Edition). Some sample solutions by Stroustrup can be found here. The directory ppt_slides contains the old version of the slides on Stroustrup's website, as the current ones are updated for the 2nd edition of the book and C++11. In code_snippets, there are all the code examples in the book, taken from the book's website.

Chapter 1 has no programming exercises, and for Chapter 2 I just went along and changed the same file over and over, so these solutions are not here.

Chapters 12–16 deal with GUI/graphics and use FLTK. The actual work there is not in the files containing main, but in lib_files/Graph.cpp and lib_files/Simple_window.cpp. I've done a little write-up about setting up FLTK under Visual Studio Community 2013 here.
