By Mark van Broeckhuijsen

Exercises from Stroustrup's ["Programming &ndash; Principles and Practice Using C++" (First Edition)](http://www.informit.com/store/programming-principles-and-practice-using-c-plus-plus-9780321543721). Some sample solutions by Stroustrup can be found [here](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html). The directory **ppt\_slides** contains the *old* version of the slides on [Stroustrup's website](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/lecture-slides.html), as the current ones are updated for the 2nd edition of the book and C++11. In **code_snippets**, there are all the code examples in the book, taken from [the book's website](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP1.html).
